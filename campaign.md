# Campaign Play

## Notes
Aside from the obvious goal of building an army, I wanted to play with the idea "I'm not playing that game". (Something a friend says when not going for scenario points.) It's important to balance things so that conflict is still happening but that players may not have the same end goals. Campaign, even more so than just Scenario play, is intended to be a point salad of conflict. If side goals and multiple scenario goals in a single game aren't fostering conflict, it will need to change. No game should consist of competitors sitting on sides not interacting.

## Overview
In the vastness of the multiverse, mercenary companies take many forms. They may be called Companies, Units, Clans, Fellowships, Syndicates, Dogs of War, Sellswords, Contractors, etc. Regardless of their name, they share one common thread: they are groups willing to resolve conflicts through force, for a price. The campaign rules are intended to let you build and upgrade a force over time. They're also a hope you'll tell a story in the process.

## The World of Conflict
At the heart of this campaign lies Conflict—an artificial planet created by multiple cosmic entities who shared the philosophy of "Growth through Conflict." This constructed world serves as a crucible where beings from across the multiverse gather to test their mettle and seek out kindred spirits who understand the true cost of growth.

Some who come to Conflict are chosen by the planet itself, marked to gather others and spread this philosophy of growth through combat across the multiverse. These chosen few become the catalysts for change across countless worlds.

## Campaign Structure
In campaign play, players take on the role of mercenary leaders, beginning their journey as individual operators and growing into commanders of renowned armies. Through linked scenarios, players will:

- Build their reputation across the multiverse.
- Grow their forces from a single model to a full army.
- Tell the story of how a lone warrior builds, trains, and leads their mercenary company to prominence across multiple dimensions, leaving their mark on the history of Conflict itself.

### Starting a Campaign

Get a group of friends. Each player will need to document the rise of their mercenary company. This is intended to be shared, and lore/fluff is encouraged. Decide how long you want the campaign to run for. The player with the highest ranking at the end wins. Players will use the [Character Creation](characterCreation.md) rules and 45 points to build their leader. They will then play a game with a singular scenario: [Seize Fate](#starting-scenario-seize-fate).

### Setting up a Campaign Game

- Matchmaking:
  **Conflict** rules should support many play variations. The first goal is to ensure no matter how many people showed up to play that everyone gets to play. This means games might be 1v1v1 or 2v1 or other combinations. Secondly, this system wants to put together fun games that are not lopsided. There is a mechanism for scoring players, and in all matchmaking, score should be used to get games as close as possible. That will mean some games make sense at a 1v1, but sometimes it will make more sense to do a 2v2. In any game where a side has multiple players, divide the army points evenly. If that isn't doable, only the player with the higher score on a team may spend fewer points so their teammate can bring more. This is intended to help get games as close as possible in points when players won't have access to the same points.

## Campaign Currencies

Campaign progression is tracked through two primary currencies: **Renown** & **Coin**.

### Coin

The economic backbone of your mercenary company, earned primarily through successful contracts. This currency lets you train or transform members of your organization.

<!--
NOTE: Each team has their own scenario the job they were hired to do they get paid based on that but maybe they get renown for stopping the opposing team or keeping their points low some how.
-->

### Renown

A measure of your company's reputation, gained through memorable actions, bold strategies, and the difficulty of your jobs. This currency lets you recruit new members & promote members to leaders if you have a License for Conflict.

#### Recruiting Characters

Players can spend **Renown** to recruit a new character:
- 20 Renown for a new character costing <= 30 points.
- 40 Renown for a new character costing <= 60 points.
- 100 Renown for a new character costing <= 90 points.

#### Promotion

Each team has to have a model that is designated as its leader. A player's first character is always the head of the organization, but that model doesn't need to be brought to every game. Other characters can be promoted to allow them to lead a force.
- 30 Renown to upgrade a character.

<!--
  NOTE: Maybe have multiple levels of promotion. Also perhaps give once a game abilities to leaders. The level of leader would determine how powerful the ability is.
-->

## Campaign Specific Features

### Last Stand

Characters that are removed from the game after losing all their wounds aren't dead; they're wounded, and the mercenary groups gather their own and get healed back up for the next job—usually, that is. If a player is losing on a scenario, they can, in response to a character losing all their wounds, decide to permanently kill a character to gain one last activation. Don't feel too bad about it; the mercenary group obviously has insurance on all its members, and the group gets a coin payout.

**Trigger:**
When a character loses all their wounds, instead of being removed from the game, the player can choose to activate "Last Stand" if these conditions are met:
* Round >= 3
* Player has fewer scenario points
* Player has not used **Last Stand** this game

**Effect:**
When activated, follow these steps:
1. The character removes all tokens and gains +1 to all stats.
2. The character can immediately take a turn.
3. Remove the character from the game. The character is no longer available to the player's team for future Campaign games.
4. The player receives a 35 coin payout.
