# Campaign Play

## Notes
Aside from the obvious goal of building an army I wanted to play with the idea "I'm not playing that game". It's important to balance things so that conflict is still happening but that players may not have the same end goals. Campaign even more so than just Scenario play is intended to be a point salad of conflict. If side goals and multiple scenario goals in a single game isn't fostering conflict It will need to change, no game should consist of competitors sitting on sides not interacting.

## Overview
In the vastness of the multiverse, mercenary companies take many forms - they may be called Companies, Units, Clans, Fellowships, Syndicates, Dogs of War, Sellswords, or Contractors. Regardless of their name, they share one common thread: they are groups willing to resolve conflicts through force, for a price.

## The World of Conflict
At the heart of this campaign lies Conflict - an artificial planet created by multiple cosmic entities who shared the philosophy of "Growth through Conflict." This constructed world serves as a crucible where beings from across the multiverse gather to test their mettle and seek out kindred spirits who understand the true cost of growth.

Some who come to Conflict are chosen by the planet itself, marked to gather others and spread this philosophy of growth through combat across the multiverse. These chosen few become the catalysts for change across countless worlds.

## Campaign Structure
In campaign play, players take on the role of mercenary leaders, beginning their journey as individual operators and growing into commanders of renowned armies. Through linked scenarios, players will:

- Build their reputation across the multiverse
- Grow their forces from a single model to a full army

Each campaign tells the story of how a lone warrior builds, trains, and leads their mercenary company to prominence across multiple dimensions, leaving their mark on the history of Conflict itself.

## Campaign Currencies
Campaign progression is tracked through two primary currencies:
- **Coin:** The economic backbone of your mercenary company, earned primarily through successful contracts. This currency lets you train or transform members of your organization.
- **Renown:** A measure of your company's reputation, gained through memorable actions and bold strategies. This currency lets you recruit new members if you have a License for Conflict.
