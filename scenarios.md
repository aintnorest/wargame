# Game Setup & Scenarios

## Pre-Game Setup

### Matchmaking
  **Conflict** rules should support many play variations. The goal is to ensure no matter how many people showed up to play that everyone gets to play. This means games might be 1v1v1 or 2v1 or other combinations.

### Board Setup

- Start with scenario pieces.
  Each Scenario should have a setup list. Player's will place the scenario pieces from the scenario they selected one piece at a time and then alternating. If a piece of terrain would overlap another use minimal displacement while attempting to keep placement as equidistance to the Player's deployment, If this isn't possible it's the placing player's choice. Zones can overlap.

  Optionally may replace up to 3 regular terrain pieces with **Advantageous Terrain**
